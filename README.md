I'm 32 years old, I'm a Physicist (degree and bachelor's degree) and Systems Analyst (technologist), with some specializations and a Master's degree in Physics and Astronomy.

I am currently a substitute professor of Physics, Programming and Robotics at the Department of Education of the State of Paran√° (SEED-PR) and I am a civil servant working as a laboratory technician for Modern Physics and Structure of Matter in the Department of Physics at the Federal University of Paran√° (UFPR).

At the age of 10, I had my first contact with HTML, but I learned a lot about the subject from the age of 14 to 16, when I built at least four websites at UFPR and deepened my knowledge in CSS. At 18 I learned PHP and MySQL. I worked at a web development company for a short time due to my approval to be a public servant in the field of Physics. Unfortunately, over the years, much of my work has been erased because it has become a legacy, however, I am updating myself and studying the source codes to create new projects and solutions.

### Front / Back Programmer since childhood

Born in times when NVU was my best friend, I grew up and worked as a developer, mainly FrontEnd, however, life separated me from this project from a very cool career that before considered only a ‚ú®hobby‚ú®;

For years I performed several other tasks and jobs, which made my PHP5.3 / 7.0 codes become a ‚ö°legacy üòÑ and become the reason for the desire for a professional renewal and relearning;

üå± Today I work in the development of solutions in PHP7.4 and JavaScript using MariaDB / MySQL databases;

Linux user ‚ù§, my main development tools for Apache2 / NodeJS are Gedit, Visual Studio Code, GitKraken, FileZilla and Shell Terminal üíª;

Study on PHP8, Frameworks / Libraries (Laravel, Angular, NodeJS, React, NextJS), NoSQL databases (Mongodb) and Mobile Applications (Ionic and ReactNative).

I have also dedicated my time to learning the Maker Culture, dedicating myself to Arduino, ESP32 and Educational Robotics.

### ... Not just IT

üî≠ I still have Physics training and because of the academic environment üë®, I worked as a researcher ü§î in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãAstrophysics and Cosmology, studying Machine Learning applications and other advantages of the Python language at the same time that I perform N-Body Simulations.
